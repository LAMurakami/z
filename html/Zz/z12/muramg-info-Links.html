I used EasyBib (one of the links on the

 to create the above citation).

Keyboarding Practice</a> - "Online Keyboarding Practice"
<dd>Page not Found
<br>Only the site part of the <a href="http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/cjh/appliedtech/Business/Keyboarding/">
http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/cjh/appliedtech/Business/Keyboarding/</a> URL works.
<br>The <a href="http://www.davis.k12.ut.us">http://www.davis.k12.ut.us</a>
page redirects to <a href="http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/davis/site/default.asp">
http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/davis/site/default.asp</a> which might indicate that the original site is now on a server hosting multiple sites and the Davis School District section is now using Active Server Pages (ASP).
<br>Searching Keyboarding Practice from the main page brings up a lot of broken keyboarding links.
<br>After searching through these links I found a few good ones:<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/213810331113946840/site/default.asp">
Elementary Keyboarding</a>
<li><a href="http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/213810331113946840/blank/browse.asp?a=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&c=57062&213810331113946840Nav=|&NodeID=12541">Keyboarding Practice Materials</a>
<li>Link to: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/typing/levels/level1.shtml">
Dance Mat Typing at BBC schools</a></ul>
The first link above has a long numerical part in the URL that could be subject to change again.  The second link includes arguments to the Active Server Page making it possibly even more transient.

It looks like this site has changed from a ColdFusion Markup File to a Google AdSense site.  I searched the new table of contents at:
<a href="http://www.kidsandcomputers.com/SiteToc.html">
http://www.kidsandcomputers.com/SiteToc.html</a>
<br>I think the main page may have been (before it became an add site):
<a href="http://www.kidsandcomputers.com/mainpb.htm">
http://www.kidsandcomputers.com/mainpb.htm</a>
<br>The change to an AdSense site means you have to scroll down a lot because the first screen of every page is now ads except the first heading.

<br>A web surfer can get to: <a href="ftp://MrM:mike24@webpages.charter.net">ftp://webpages.charter.net/</a>
<br>The URL encodes a user and password into it in a way that a web surfer can easily find.  Once there I saw filenames like your current site but with no dates newer than 10/15/2010.
<br>I was amused with: <a href="ftp://MrM:mike24@webpages.charter.net/MikeMurakami_webpage.html">MikeMurakami_webpage.html</a>
<br>The <a href="ftp://MrM:mike24@webpages.charter.net/index_temp.html">

<br>On the <a href="ftp://MrM:mike24@webpages.charter.net/MrM2Redir.htm">

<dt><a href="http://www.playscripts.com/plays/mothergoosed.pdf">
2010-2011 Drama Club</a> - "Online Script: Mother Goosed"
<dd>The pdf at: <a href="http://www.playscripts.com/plays/mothergoosed.pdf">http://www.playscripts.com/plays/mothergoosed.pdf</a> starts with two pages of copyright information and rules.  Although it may not be a copywright violation to link to this page I believe it would be to print it.
<br>The pdf ends with a notice that it is not the full play and another reference to copyright infringement.
<br>It may be better to link to the following:<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.playscripts.com/play.php3?playid=1129">
http://www.playscripts.com/play.php3?playid=1129</a></ul>
The second link includes a link to the pdf but labled as a sample.  It also includes a summary of the play but is mainly a page where you can order a copy of the script in multiple forms and pay for performances.

<h2><a name="Missing_link">Missing first link</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="muramg-info-Links.html#Missing_link" target="_top">Mr. M's Website</a> - loaded into the full, original window (thus canceling all other frames).
<dd>Mr. M uses the "_blank" target option in the reference anchors ("a href" tags) on his links page so that links are displayed in a new window (or within a new tab for browsers that support this based on their configuration).  I think he should have a first link to his main page (frames) that uses the "_top" target option so that if the links page is loaded outside his frameset, a surfer can get to his main site.
<p>The above link uses this and I created <a href="Frames.html">a frameset example</a> to show this.
<p>Using the <a href="Frames.html">a frameset example</a> link when already in a frameset will cause nested instances of the frameset.  Using the <a href="muramg-info-Links.html#Missing_link" target="_top">Mr. M's Website</a> link will result in all frames being cancelled.
<p>I have used frames and they have their place but keeping track of how to control the links can be tedious.
