<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>I have included this note along with a $1,000.00 check thinking the check will get your attention and maybe it will get you to participate in the:
</p>
<h2><span id="Uncle_Larry_Retirement_Incentive_Plan">Uncle Larry Retirement Incentive Plan</span></h2>
<p>If you contribute $1,000.00 to a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) I will Reimburse you $1,000.00 when you send me a copy of the statement showing the deposit.
</p><p>If you contribute a second $1,000.00 to a Roth IRA in the same contribution year I will Reimburse you $2,000.00 (double cash back) when you send me a copy of the statement showing the deposit.
</p><p>This is $3,000.00 for depositing $2,000.00 into a Roth IRA and $1,000.00 for depositing $1,000.00 into a Roth IRA.  I will continue doing this for every year I am still alive.
</p><p>I am doing this to give you extra incentive to practice some deferred gratification and prepare for retirement.  I am very happy that I don't have to rely on Social Security to be retired right now.  I am happy to have it and Medicare but am very happy it is not all I have.
</p><p>The deposits to a Roth IRA are after tax dollars and you must have earned income to make a Roth IRA deposit.  If you need earned income I have some organizing and cleaning work at my house I can pay you $20.00 an hour for.
</p><p>$2,000.00 compounded annually at 8% with additional $2,000.00 contributions annually grows to over $100,000.00 in 20 years.  At 13% gains it would be over $180.000.00 and at only 3% it would still be over $55,000.00.  With the Uncle Larry Retirement Incentive Plan you could do this and have all the deposits refunded by me along with an additional $21,000.00 at $1,000.00 a year plus the initial $1,000.00 you could do whatever you want with including add to the annual Roth IRA deposits.
</p><p>You can deposit into a Roth IRA account as late as April 15th. of the following year.
