<div style="font-family: verdana, geneva; text-align: left;">Friends,</div>
<div style="font-family: verdana, geneva; text-align: left;">
<br></div>
<div style="font-family: verdana, geneva; text-align: left;">For the coming New Year, I'm proud to unveil our new campaign logo which you can see above. &nbsp;A big thank you to my brother, Michael Dunsmore, for the awesome graphic work. &nbsp;Michael has helped me win some of the toughest elections in the state of the last decade, electing strong progressive leaders across Alaska.</div>

<br></div>
<div style="font-family: verdana, geneva; text-align: left;">Since I announced I was running to serve my neighbors on the Anchorage Assembly, I have been honored and humbled by the support I have received. &nbsp;

The end of the year is an important fundraising deadline, and I hope you will please consider clicking here to and making a
<span style="font-size: 10pt;" mce_style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;contribution today.</span></a>
&nbsp; Your contribution will help demonstrate strong support for electing a new generation of progressive leadership.</div>

<div style="font-family: verdana, geneva; text-align: left;">Anchorage is facing many challenges: the state is facing a budget crisis that threatens city services, politicians are trying to cut funding for our schools, and reactionary forces are trying to repeal our landmark Equal Rights Ordinance. &nbsp;I am ready to put my experience to work to stand up for our schools and equal rights for all Alaskans. &nbsp;Rather than cutting local services, we need to work to make our city even better. &nbsp;Working together we can improve public transportation, revitalize our neighborhoods, and end homelessness in Anchorage and making housing affordable.</div>
