<h1>First Delta plane serviced! / End of an Era!</h1>
aka: My first picture downloaded from my cell phone!

<h2>A Delta plane at a Northwest gate
 of the Seattle Tacoma International airport (aka SEA, aka SeaTac).</h2>

My sister sent me the above picture without any associated text or any other
 information including a subject line.  I received the message on my cell
 phone early Christmas morning 2008.
<br><br>
Later on I called my sister and she told me that I had correctly guessed
 the message she had sent me and the context on my first try.  It was easy
 partly because earlier that same month we had vacationed together in Kauai,
 Hawaii along with her oldest son and I had spent time at her new house
 afterwards.
<br><br>
My sisters story is that she will complete 30 years of service with
 Northwest Airlines in April of 2009 except that she doesn't know
 if it will be recognized.  Northwest Airlines merged with Delta and
 she is not sure if enough of Northwest Airlines will be left to give
 her the traditional 30 year pin with associated ceremony.
<br><br>
The rest of the story is that this picture is taken from a vantage point
 that few have access to.  The picture was taken from the extensible walkway
 after it had been backed away from the plane which had finished boarding.
<br><br>
In my sisters words;<b>
"I began working the flight at pre dawn.
So in the darkness when I walked down to open the aircraft door to let my
 crew board I could see nothing more than the shape of an aircraft,
 and then I returned to my counter that faces away from the window
 to continue to service passengers.  So it wasn't until an hour later
 that I was preparing to head back down to the aircraft with the final
 paperwork to close the door and send it on its way to Detroit that
 I realized it was a Delta airplane."</b>
<br><br>
It was after the walkway was backed away from the plane that my sister decided 
 to use a moment to snap a picture with her cell phone and send it to me.
 When I talked to her a few hours later she admitted
 that she may have heard comments from passengers about the plane,
 but was busy being a Northwest Airlines terminal employee helping passengers
 boarding the plane.  It was extra busy because of the snow and weather related
 additional considerations that affected the Christmas flying travel of many
 in 2008.
<br><br>
My sister is not an advanced user of all the latest communications
 technology.  I have to admit that I do not text more than I call
 and seldom send pictures.
<br><br>
I have had my RAZR for at least two and one half years,
 and I remember initially investigating the ability to
 connect it to a PC and related features.  My memory
 tells me I found answers in the $50.00 range but
 never pursued it any further.
<br><br>
So this picture was so important that I figured out how to get it
 off of my phone and once I did I decided to create this page.
<br><br>
I will edit it as necessary based on any comments I receive.
<br><br>
The quote from my sister was added after my sister saw the first version
of the page gave me some input.  Her comments also included
"That is very cool, I love it. ... 
Thank you, I can't wait to show this to some of my co-workers."
