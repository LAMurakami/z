 example program documentation</h1></center>
<ul><li>
Program lists the 'Last Run Date Time' and 'Last Run epoch time'
 from the configuration file and Current Date Time and epoch time.
<br><br><li>
The program also shows the configuration file with the updated
 parameters.
<br><br><li>
If you are the only one running the program you can see the
 current time become the last run time when you use the browser
 reload or refresh key.
</ul>
The Last-Run example program is based on the
<a href="/About/Program/Better-Config-File/">Better Configuration File</a>
program.  This program uses the basic Better Configuration File concept
along with the second enhancement.  This enhancement expects that all
lines of the configuration file conform to the basic Better Configuration
File concept of parameter lines, blank lines and comment lines entered in
any order but without the alternate end of the configuration file.  It
then updates parameters in the configuration file during the run.  This
example only updates a last run date time stamp.  All other parts of the
configuration file are left intact and even leading or trailing spaces on
the parameter name side of the parameter line are left unchanged.

I tested Last-Run with
<a href="http://z.lam1.us/Zz/z09/z0901/090127/Last-Run-01-Cannot-Open.html">

    no read access</a> to the configuration file and

<a href="http://z.lam1.us/Zz/z09/z0901/090127/Last-Run-01-Cannot-Update.html">

    no write access</a> to the configuration file

and cleaned up the error pages.
I decided to include the program header which includes a link to the
<a href="/About/Program/Last-Run/">program documentation</a> in the
error pages.  I also added bolding to the cause of the error returned when
the open request failed.  In this testing case it was Permission denied
caused by setting permissions at 600 and 644 to get the cannot open and
cannot update error pages.

I published the above links after creating .html files from the .htm files
captured by my browser by stripping the head and menuBar information so that
the z.lam1.us menuBar will be the only one displayed.

Wednesday, January 28, 2009 @ 1:46:10 AM (Alaska Time) - After publishing
 this page and the program I noticed that I was not preserving comments
 if present on parameter lines that were being updated so I fixed this.
 An updated parameter is preceded and followed by a single space and
 additional white space between the '=' and the parameter or between
 the parameter and the '#' is now the only thing changed along with
 a parameter update.
