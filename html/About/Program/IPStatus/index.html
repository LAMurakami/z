<h1>LAM Alaska IP Status program documentation</h1>
</center>

The <a href="/Public/Scripts/IPStatus.cgi-pl">IPStatus</a>
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Perl script uses a module
 of the libwww-perl collection to get the router status
 information from the internal router and display it to
 the outside world.

Friday, May 8, 2015 - I updated the ASUS RT-AC66U Wireless Router Firmware.
This caused the IPStatus program to break becasue the page title
 I had been testing for was changed. I replaced a test of the page title with a
 test for function wanlink_status in the page.
The Firmware update left the page mostly the same but with no page title.
The 5GHz N+AC mode UI issue I was complaining about was fixed
 11/25/2015 according to the release notes.  It also looks like a couple of ssl
 vulnerabilities were fixed as well.  The admin web interface had been failing
 but that might have been my IPStatus page unable to deal with the strong
 suggestion that I update the firmware.
<p>My ASUS OPlay! works over wireless again.
<hr>
Saturday, July 26, 2014 - I made a number of changes to get
 the page to work with the new ASUS RT-AC66U
 instead of the Netgear WPNT834 which was failing regularly.
The ASUS RT-AC66U does not report the "DHCP Server"
 and reports all values with javascript code.
Instead of "Lease Obtained" the lease duration is reported.
I used a humanTime function to report the "Lease Expires"
 and "Lease Time" values with "Lease Expires" color highlighting
 based on > 2/3 of lease time remaining.
<hr>
Saturday, April 19, 2014 @ 9:14:51 PM (Alaska Time) -
Added a $timeLeaseColor to highlight 'Lease Obtained'
 with the 'Change Detected color' when lease obtained in the future.
This has been happening with the new 69.178.111.4 IP Address I got with the new cable modem.

Saturday, January 24, 2009 @ 9:22:23 PM (Alaska Time) -
Added links to program source, revision history, pending changes
 and such that are available via the LAM::displaySource() function.
I updated both the cgi-pl and programs for
 <a href="/About/Program/Better-Config-File">Better Configuration File</a>
 handling based on the newly created program.

 - I am up to version 1.16 of the program and will
 no longer report the
 <a href="/About/Program/IPStatus/IPStatus-401.html">401 Unauthorized</a>
 error when the first request by the program for the router status
 information from the internal router results in this response.  Instead
 I issue a second request with the same credentials.  The second request
 is required if the authentication time limit has expired.  I first
 addressed this in the IPStatus.pl program which sends an email
 message with a html formatted table similar to that generated by
 the IPStatus.cgi-pl program.

I published version 1.11 to the public side of the site and
 then made a couple of minor changes.<br>
This program works but has only rudimentary error processing.
If the program recieves an unexpected response, it just displays
the raw data received which could be from an internal response
such as no route to host or which could be from the router but
as before an unexpected response.  This program only executes
 a single request to my router for 
status information and parse the results.  If the results are as 
expected the response is parsed and redisplayed as a simple table of 
labels and values if the IP status information.
<br><br>
This version gets unexpected results if the program has not been 
executed for a while because my router requires authentication and 
authentication requires a second request with proper credentials 
supplied if the previous authentication has expired.
<br><br>
Because this is an interactive program that second request is easily 
supplied with the reload or refresh function of a browser.  (<b>Just
click again!</b>)
<br><br>
Although only rudimentary error checking is performed by the program
I was satisfied by the display of:
<ul><li>
<a href="/About/Program/IPStatus/IPStatus-401.html">First 401 Unauthorized</a>
response encountered by the IPStatus v1.11 program.
<li>
A <a href="/About/Program/IPStatus/IPStatus-500.html">500 Can't connect</a>
response I specifically generated by pulling the power cord of my router.
</ul>
and the fact that display of the expected response is satisfactory.
