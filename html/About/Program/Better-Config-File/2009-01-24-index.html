<h1>Better Configuration File documentation</h1>

<p>The <a href="/Public/Scripts/Better-Config-File.cgi-pl">Better-Config-File</a>
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Perl script uses a number of examples from the
Perl Cookbook to provide an example to myself of better configuration file
handling.
<ul>
<li><a href="/Public/Scripts/Better-Config-File.cgi-pl?source">
Better-Config-File program source</a>
<li><a href="/Public/Scripts/Better-Config-File.cgi-pl?rlog">
Better-Config-File revision history</a>
<li><a href="/Public/Scripts/Better-Config-File.cgi-pl?diff">
Better-Config-File pending changes</a>
<li><a href="/Public/Scripts/Better-Config-File.cgi-pl?lam.pm">
Better-Config-File supporting perl module source</a>
</ul>
<p>I refer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Cookbook">
Perl Cookbook</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Perl">
Programming Perl (the Camel Book)</a> often when trying to write better perl code.

<p>Saturday, January 24, 2009 @ 12:38:58 AM (Alaska Time) - I now have a
<a href="https://q.lam1.us/Better-Config-File">Private version of the program</a>
That displays a form allowing the user to specify the configuration file to
parse.  The file can also be submitted as a GET or POST parameter and allows
me to code URLs in Private documentation that will display the values of a
particular configuration file.

<p>Friday, January 23, 2009 @ 3:30:13 AM (Alaska Time) -
I keep testing, programming and documenting and am up to version 1.7 of
this program.  In this version I added an alternate means of ending the
Basic Better Configuration File Parameter processing.  This will allow
me to extend it with a very special purpose.  I might be ready to write
runFTPjob.  This version processes versions 1.4 and 1.5 of the configuration
file with the same resulting parameter list by ignoring version 1.5 of the
file after the new terminator.

 - I have decided to make this brand new program the second public program
 documented in the <a href="/About/Program">/About/Program</a> area of my site.
<br><br>
<p>I included links to the program source, file revision history, and pending
 source file changes that are automatically available when I use one of my
 current Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Perl script templates.  These links
 have been available for my public programs for some time but I have not
 gotten around to documentation in a more human readable form.  I do spend
 a fair amount of time maiking my source readable to me and including
 comments to help in that effort.  I also included a link to the LAM perl
 module which is the main custom perl module I use in perl web page programs
 for my site.
