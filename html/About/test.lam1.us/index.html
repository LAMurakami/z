 - This site was created some time ago but the documentation page
 was only created today.  It was originally created as a place to
 test Apache site directives.  It has at times had various content
 in it for test purposes.

<br><br>Today I added a directive to map <a href="/About">/About</a>
 to <a href="/About">/About/test.lam1.us</a> for the default
 index.html document.  I am now using this rule	for most of the
 sites on this machine with only the value of the RewriteHtml
 environment variable being different for each site.  The exception
 is the <a href="http://z.lam1.us/">z.lam1.us site</a> which allows
 browsing of the /About folder.  I need to create an About About
 page to document this.
