<h2>About this page</h2>
This web page shows by example how to make a CGI script recognize if being
 accessed by an authenticated user and act differently if so.
The example shows a recent change to <a href=/man>the man perl cgi script
 on this site</a>.
The change was made so that some man pages would not be available to the public.
<h3>Overview of the change</h3>
<p>Although the change was implemented so that a single version of the man.cgi-pl
 perl script handles both behaviors, a symbolic link was created in the
 Private/Scripts folder pointing to the Public/Scripts version so that
 the Apache server treats it as if it were two versions.
<pre>ln -sT /var/www/html/Public/Scripts/man.cgi-pl /var/www/html/Private/Scripts/man.cgi-pl</pre>
This is because the existence of the REMOTE_USER environment variable is used
 which is only set by Apache for pages in a directory or subdirectory that requires
 authentication.  The symbolic link allows there to be only one program (only one
 place to edit and maintain) but have Apache control access to to what it treats as
 a separate program. This then allows the program to test for the the existence of
 the REMOTE_USER environment variable to control which set of man pages are made available.
<h3>Perl cgi script code segment</h3>
<pre>if (not defined $ENV{'REMOTE_USER'}) {     # If not an authenticated remote user
    $ENV{'MANPATH'} = '/usr/share/man';    # Set MANPATH to omit local man pages.
}</pre>
The end effect of this change only affects the display of man pages by the Appache server
 to unauthenticated users on the unsecured side of the website. A user who signs on to the
 secure side of the website is unaffected.  A user who goes to the secure side and uses the
 man link without authorizing will get an "Authorization Required!" message.
<p>If unauthenticated, a user can only see man pages in the /usr/share/man tree.
<h2>Apache configuration</h2>
The change described above is dependant on an Apache configuration detailed below.
<h3>Apache configuration description</h3>
In the main Apache configuration file an Alias is set for /Public
 and cgi-scripts are enabled in that directory.
A number of locations including /Private are forced to be handled
 by the secure side of the server (port 443).
<p>
In the default host configuraton file a document root is set 
 but scripts are allowed as if they were in the root directory
 with file names without an extension by a conditional rewrite rule.
An aditional rewrite rule allows the man pages to be accesses as if
 they were files in a man directory.
<p>
In the ssl virtual host configuraton file a different document root
 is set, scripts are allowed anywhere within that directory tree and
 Apache is instructed to follow symbolic links.
 Again some scripts are allowed to be accessed as if they were in the
 root directory with file names without an extension by a conditional
 rewrite rule.  This rule is applied to scripts in the /Private
 directory rather than the /Public directory and the Last flag is used
 so that no other rules are checked when this rule is satisfied.
The order of the rules and the Last flag make it so that if a script
 exists in both the /Public and /Private folders the /Private script
 will be used if accessed from the secured side of the site.
A number of locations including /Private can only be accessed by
 authenticated users.  These locations were previously forced to be
 handled on the secure port which means the authentication process
 only occurs on the secure port.

...</pre><h2>Summary</h2>
This page shows a small code segment and a relatively simple change but it is dependant
 on the web server to set an environment variable under specific circumstances
 that can then be tested by the program.  All the Apache configuration detailed above
 was already in place but a minor change was made to one rule.
That was to replace /Public with /Private in the rewrite rule for "^/man/(.+)$"
 in the secure configuration file.
