QPRINT is a simple command-line filter which encodes and decodes
files in Quoted-Printable encoding as defined in RFC 1521.  For
details on operation of the program, please consult the manual
page "qprint.1" or its HTML equivalent "index.html" included in
this distribution.

For information on how to build and install the program, see
the INSTALL file.  Win32 users may, if they wish, use the
ready-to-run qprint.exe file included in the archive.  Source
code for this program is written in the CWEB "Literate Programming"
language in which C source code and TeX internal documentation
are maintained in a single qprint.w file.  CWEB programming tools
may be downloaded from:

    http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html

but you do *not* need to install the CWEB tools to build this
program; a ready-to-compile C program is included.  An annotated
source code listing is provided in the file qprint.pdf, which may
be read with Acrobat Reader, which is a free download from:

    http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html
