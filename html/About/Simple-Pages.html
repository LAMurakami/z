<center><h1>LAM Alaska simple pages</h1>
</center>
The site uses a Perl CGI program to act as what I
 call a wrapper.  The program applies on the fly updates
 to the raw html pages to add a common style and a bit
 of dynamic content.  This is enabled within Apache by the
 the following directive:
<br><br><b>
RewriteRule ^/(.+)\.html$ <a href="/Public/Scripts/menuBar.cgi-pl">
/Public/Scripts/menuBar.cgi-pl</a> [QSA,PT,E=RewriteHtml:/$1.html]
</b><br>
<br>I have included a link to the program in the above that will display
 the program description which will include a link to the program source.
<br>
<br>This page can be viewed in it's raw form at:
<a href="/About/Simple-Pages.htm">
/About/Simple-Pages.htm</a>
or in it's form after the wrapper processing at:
 <a href="/About/Simple-Pages.html">/About/Simple-Pages.html</a>
<br>
<br>To really appreciate the difference use the view source option
 of your browser and compare the two source views generated with
 different Apache directives from the same html file.
