Within the content of this site, <b>public refers to URLs
 available without authentication</b> and private refers to URLs
 only available from the secure virtual host to
 an authenticated user. A public URL may be available on either a
 unsecured (http://) or secured (https://) site or both.
<br><br><b>
The bulk of content on my site is private and thus only
 available from the secure virtual host to
 an authenticated user.</b>  Most of the private usage on my site is
 from a single user and that user is myself.  Some family members and
 friends have been given credentials for access including
 my brother for whom I host his public website and a friend
 who has local access to my machines including the main server.
<br><br>
The public structure I created at z.lam1.us is also available at cabo.lam1.us
 via symbolic links created in my Cabo folder such as:
<br><br>
ln -s ../z/Zz
<br>
ln -s ../z/About
<br><br>
The public structure I created at z.lam1.us may also be available via symbolic links created in the root folder of my secure site such as:
<br><br>
ln -s Public/Content/z/About
<br><br>
All my public sites are in my /Public/Content folder
 which is an alias across sites.
<br><br>
The Zz public structure I created in the z folder of the
 z.lam1.us site is a subset of what I provide access
 to on the secure site with an private alias to within the mount
 of the TeraStation RAID Network Storage.
<br><br>
The subset of files is provided with symbolic links to
 individual files or folders within the duplicate folder
 structure under the Zz folder.  A link to a folder is
 only used when all the items in the private
<br><br>
A site without a main page, with the proper Apache directive, can be browsed and with another Apache directive the symbolic links can be browsed as well.  Some of the index related Apache directives on my site are:

&lt;/Directory&gt;
