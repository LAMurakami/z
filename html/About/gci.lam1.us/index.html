Monday, June 5, 2017 @ 12:14:36 PM (Alaska Time) - I have ak7 back up
 and on the Internet after an outage of over 2 months after the burglary
 and theft of several of my servers.  The ASUS RT-AC66U router was not stolen
 but the antennae was damaged and I ordered a new ASUS RT-N66U router.  The
 lamurakami.asuscomm.com domain name is tied to the old router
 and the lam1ak.asuscomm.com domain name to the new one.
<li>Wednesday, February 1, 2017 @ 11:37:52 PM (Alaska Time) - Got a new IP address
 some time ago.
<li>Monday, October 17, 2016 @ 9:23:48 PM (Alaska Time) - I updated my site
 to use the ASUS Dynamic Domain Name Service that the ASUS RT-AC66U router
 can update automatically.  I registered a lamurakami host name and created
 CNAME records pointing to lamurakami.asuscomm.com to replace the A records
 with IP addresses that I was manually updating.  This means that when my
 gateway gets a new external IP address I don't have to do anything for my
 domain names to still point to my router.
<li>Thursday, January 8, 2009 @ 8:39:28 PM - I created this site as part of the project
 to be able to <a href="http://z.lam1.us/Public/Scripts/IPStatus.cgi-pl">
 see my IP Address from outside my Local Area Network</a> and to have my
 server report it's IP Address by email and to a static web page if it changes.
